## 1D-Ising-model-with-configurations
Applied NumPy in Jupyter notebook to simulate 1D Ising model and visualized all the numerical configurations and energy level degenercy, to find the intersection with Boltzmann distribution function.


## 2D-Ising-Model
A brief introduction to 2D Ising Model and calculation of temperature, magnetic moment, and energy.

A simple demonstration of Buffon's needle problem.
